Take out doc/.cvsignore out of archive.
Fix bug reported by Alexander H if base point is over smaller field
  and generators over larger field
Fix manual by using 5th argument of MakeGAPDocDoc.

Later:

Known left and right subgroups for BacktrackSearch
Intersection of stabilizer chains???
Verification in Ordnung mit strongbelow
picklers?
FindVectorsWithShortOrbit: schneller
Repair deterministic verification with new layout
AddGeneratorsToStabilizerChain for trivial stabchains testen
Random element generation with pools etc. besser testen


Add benchmark tests like in matrixss.

Later:
 * deterministic verification
 * lots of methods using stabilizer chains
 * Soluble-Method
 * MeatAxe method
