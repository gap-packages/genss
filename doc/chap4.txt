  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  describes  the  methods  for  backtrack  search  in the [5Xgenss[105X
  package.  Note  that  the  code  in  this area is not yet very stable and is
  almost  certainly  going  to  change in subsequent versions of this package.
  This might also concern the interfaces and calling conventions.[133X

  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XG[122X be the group described by the stabiliser chain [3XS[103X. The group element [3Xg[103X
  must  be  some  element  in  an overgroup [22Xhat G[122Xof [22XG[122X such that the function [3XP[103X
  described below is defined on the whole of [22Xhat G[122X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis operation implements a generic backtrack search in the coset [22XG[3Xg[103X[122X looking
  for  an  element [22Xx in G[122X such that [3XP[103X[22X(x[3Xg[103X)[122X is [9Xtrue[109X where [3XP[103X is a function on [22Xhat
  G[122Xtaking  values [9Xtrue[109X and [9Xfalse[109X. The operation returns the group element [22Xx[122X if
  one is found or [9Xfail[109X if none was found.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe search tree is given by the stabiliser chain, each node corresponds to a
  right coset of one of the stabilisers in the chain. The leaves correspond to
  right cosets of the identity group, i.e. to group elements in [22XG[3Xg[103X[122X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  make this backtrack search efficient some pruning of the search tree has
  to be done. To this end there is the fourth argument [3Xpruner[103X which can either
  be  [9Xfalse[109X (in which case no pruning at all happens) or a [5XGAP[105X function taking
  5  arguments  and  returning  either  [9Xtrue[109X  or [9Xfalse[109X. The function [3Xpruner[103X is
  called  for  every  node  in  the  search  tree  before the backtrack search
  descents  into  the  subtrees.  If  the  [3Xpruner[103X  function returns [9Xfalse[109X, the
  complete  subtree  starting  at  the  current  node is pruned and no further
  search  is  performed  there.  If the result is [9Xtrue[109X (or [3Xpruner[103X was equal to
  [9Xfalse[109X  altogether) then the subtree starting at the current node is searched
  recursively.  Obviously,  the  [3Xpruner[103X  function  needs  to  know the current
  position in the search tree, which it is told by its arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach  node  in  the search tree corresponds to a coset of some stabiliser of
  the  stabiliser chain in its previous one. To set up some notation, let [23X G =

  and  let  [23X  O_1,  O_2,  \ldots,  O_m [123X be the basic orbits. Then for the node
  corresponding  to the coset [22XS_i t[3Xg[103X[122X for [22Xi ge 1[122X and some transversal element [22Xt[122X
  contained  in [22XS_{i-1}[122X the arguments with which the [3Xpruner[103X function is called
  are  the  following:  The  first  argument  is  the  stabiliser chain object
  corresponding to [22XS_{i-1}[122X. The second argument is the index of the element in
  [22XO_i[122X  corresponding  to  the transversal element [22Xt[122X. The third argument is the
  group  element [22Xt[3Xg[103X[122X and the fourth argument is equal to the actual transversal
  element  [22Xt[122X. The fifth argument is a word in the generators used to enumerate
  [22XO_i[122X  expressing  [22Xt[122X,  the  word  comes  as  a  list of integers which are the
